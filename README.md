# The Wagi Codewalk

**Don't Panic!** This seemingly empty repo is the beginning of your journey for learning Wagi.
Over the course of this codewalk, you will build a simple web application with
Wagi, Rust, and WebAssembly.

This Codewalk uses Git and GitHub to walk you through the process. At every step of
the way, you will have code that compiles and runs. And it's as easy as `git checkout`.

Here's what we're going to do: We are going to build a small web page generator that
converts Markdown to HTML and serves images. Groundbreaking? Nope. But it's a great
way to get started.

Here's how we're going to do it:

- Introduction: That's where you are now.
- Chapter 1: Configure your environment.
- Chapter 2: Hello World! (You knew it was coming).
- Chapter 3: Hello CGI: A small refinement on our starting point.
- Chapter 4: Adding Markdown support
- Chapter 5: Serving Images

## Git All The Things!

This codewalk uses Git to walk you through all the examples. We hope the reasons for this
will be self-evident as you go... but for starters, you'll get examples that build
and run at every step of the way.

So to get started, all you need to do is `git checkout ch1-configure`. (Or if you're
using GitHub, you can just choose the branch from the dropdown list.)
